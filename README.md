# NETACAD-DEVASC SKILLS-BASED EXAM SEP 2021

## Task 1 -- GitHub Skills Test
### Task preparation
GitHub account and working virtual machine needed.
### Task implementation
1. I created a directory using ```mkdir Devasc_Skills``` and then initialised a local git repository with ```git init``` inside that newly created directory.
2. Each time a task was completed I added the relevant files into the folder.
3. I created a remote GitHub repository in my web browser and then connected my local repository to it using ```git remote add origin https://github.com/LoukaOctave/devasc-skills.git```, ```git fetch origin```, and ```git checkout main```. In this step I needed to authenticate myself using my credentials.
4. EXPLAIN UPLOAD PROCEDURE
5. After every step I took screenshots of my work/results.
6. The README.md file was automatically created when I made the repository. I kept it up-to-date by editing in Pluma.
### Task troubleshooting
In step 3 I encountered a warning which said that support for password authentication was removed on August 13, 2021. I followed the instructions listed right after and created a personal access token in my GitHub developer settings, which I used to complete the task.
### Task verification
After fetching the origin for the first time, the README.md file - that only existed on the remote - appeared in my local. EXPLAIN HOW TASKS FROM LOCAL COULD BE PUSHED TO REMOTE
